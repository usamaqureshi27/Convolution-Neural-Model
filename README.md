# Convolution_model_Application

In this notebook I have built ConvNets to create a nummeric digit classifier that identify the digits from 0 to 9, while gaining familiarity with the TF Keras Sequential APIs along the way.

The model that has been made after preprosessing of mnist dataset has an almost 80% accuracy on the test set. 

Other tasks performed in 1st optional assignment of coursera case studies:

1. Implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including forward propagation
2. Apply two different types of pooling operation
3. Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose
4. Build a convolutional neural network
